Card spend analysis using SQL involves examining transaction data from credit or debit card records to gain insights into spending patterns, trends, and anomalies in India.
The Dataset was Extracted from Kaggle : 

## Understanding the Data

Before we start writing SQL queries, it's essential to understand the structure of our data. Typically, our card transaction data is stored in tables with the following columns:

`transaction_id` : Unique identifier for each transaction.

`city` : Geographical location of the transaction.

`transaction_date` : Date time of the transaction done.

`card_type` : Type of card through which the transaction has been done by the user.

`exp_type` : On what type of expenses are done from card.

`gender` : Male or Female who has done the transaction, "M" denotes Male and "F" denotes Female.

`amount` : Amount spent in the transaction by the user.
