# Challenges that Bank is facing to solve 

In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.


# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

- 1.Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

- 2.Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

- 3.Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

- 4.Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

- 5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.



# Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s

In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria

## Good Loan KPIs:

- 1.Good Loan Application Percentage: We need to calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans.' This category includes loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

- 2.Good Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category, which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

- 3.Good Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans.' This includes the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

- 4.Good Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans,' which encompasses all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

## Bad Loan KPIs:

- 1.Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculating the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans.' This category specifically includes loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

- 2.Bad Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans,' which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

- 3.Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans.' This comprises the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

- 4.Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans,' which includes all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

## Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' This report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as 
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount
- MTD Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.


# DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW

In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. 

Below are the specific chart requirements:

- 1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):
Chart Type: Line Chart

X-Axis: Month (based on 'Issue Date')
Y-Axis: Metrics' Values

**Objective:** This line chart will showcase how 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received' vary over time, allowing us to identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

- 2. Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):
Chart Type: Filled Map
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'
Geographic Regions: States

**Objective:** This filled map will visually represent lending metrics categorized by state, enabling us to identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.

- 3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):
Chart Type: Donut Chart
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'
Segments: Loan Terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months)

**Objective:** This donut chart will depict loan statistics based on different loan terms, allowing us to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

- 4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):
Chart Type: Bar Chart
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'
X-Axis: Employee Length Categories (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 10+ years)
Y-Axis: Metrics' Values

**Objective:** This bar chart will illustrate how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

- 5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):
Chart Type: Bar Chart
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'
X-Axis: Loan Purpose Categories (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing)
Y-Axis: Metrics' Values

**Objective:** This bar chart will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.

- 6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):
Chart Type: Tree Map
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'
Hierarchy: Home Ownership Categories (e.g., own, rent, mortgage)

**Objective:** This tree map will display loan metrics categorized by different home ownership statuses, allowing for a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
These diverse chart types will enhance our ability to visualize and communicate loan-related insights effectively, supporting data-driven decisions and strategic planning within our lending operations."


# DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS
In our Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
