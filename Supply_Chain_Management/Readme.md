# Supply Chain Management

## Project Overview

Supply Chain Management for Cars in Power BI provides a comprehensive overview of the entire supply chain process for automotive companies. This includes tracking the flow of materials, components, and finished products from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and ultimately to customers.
Using Power BI, companies can visualize key supply chain metrics such as inventory levels, production schedules, delivery performance, and supplier quality. They can also analyze historical data to identify trends, optimize operations, and make informed decisions to improve efficiency and reduce costs throughout the supply chain.
